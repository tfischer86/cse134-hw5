                <h2>The Epic Quest to Draw My Cats</h2>

                <p>
                    Recently, I decided to try
                    using a set of Faber-Castell Pitt Graphite Matt pencils to draw my cat, Hazel.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Faber-Castell Pitt Graphite Matt pencils are advertised to have less shininess than typical
                    graphite pencils. These pencils have a more subdued finish, which can help create a more natural
                    look.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since this was my first time using these pencils, I used graph paper since I only have 20 sheets of
                    the good stuff and I didn't want to waste any.
                    Despite this, I think I was able to achieve my goal of a lifelike drawing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To begin my drawing, I started by sketching the outline of Hazel's face using a
                    mechanical pencil. I usually start drawing the eyes, nose, and mouth, since they're the hardest to
                    get right.
                    In particular, the eyes needed a lot of work before they finally looked real. If they're even
                    slightly off, the whole drawing enters the uncanny valley and just looks creepy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next, I filled out the rest of her body. I used a blending stump to give the drawing a soft fluffy
                    look, and I used an eraser to add highlights that make the fur look shiny.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Overall, I spent about 8 hours working on it over a few nights. This was my first time attempting to
                    create a photo-realistic drawing, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. I would highly
                    recommend these pencils to anyone who is interested in drawing.
