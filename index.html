                <h2>Welcome!</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello and welcome to my portfolio site! My name is Thomas Fischer and I'm a computer science student
                    with a passion for open source development and software engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently working on my B.S. in Computer Science from UC San Diego.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an active contributor to open source projects, I have worked on many high-profile projects like
                    Vim and i3.
                    My contributions include fixing bugs, implementing new features and improving the user
                    experience of these projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have over 5 years of experience in Java, C, C++ and Python. I am also
                    familiar with web development and have worked with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

                    I am interested in many fields of programming, including machine learning, real time graphics,
                    networking, and multithreaded programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from programming, I am also interested in music and art. I am an avid reader and love to learn
                    about new technologies and
                    advancements in the field.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My ultimate career goal is to become a software engineer at a leading tech company where I can work
                    on
                    challenging and innovative projects. I hope to contribute to open source projects in my free time,
                    helping
                    to create software that benefits people around the world.
                </p>
